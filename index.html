        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>My name is Andrew Aydelott and I had two dreams for what I wanted to do 
            when I grew up.  The first was to work for the FBI.  The second was to become an archaeologist.
             After 20 years with the FBI, I have decided to take an early retirement
             and pursue my second career as an archaeologist to fulfill both childhood
             goals. I will be graduating from El Camino
             College with an anthropology degree at the end of the 2024 fall semester.
             After graduation, I plan on transferring to Cal State University Long Beach to earn my bachelor's degree.
